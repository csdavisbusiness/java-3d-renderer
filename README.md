# Simple 3D Renderer in Java
A lightweight, pure Java software renderer that renders basic 3D shapes (e.g., cubes) 
using Java 2D (AWT/Swing). Features wireframe rendering, filled triangles, and basic 
perspective projection. Built for educational purposes and as a portfolio piece.

## Features
- Renders 3D models (e.g., cubes) from `.obj` files.
- Supports wireframe and filled triangle rendering.
- Basic perspective projection and rotation.
- No external dependencies (pure Java).

## Setup
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/csdavisbusiness/java-3d-renderer.git`
2. Compile and run using Java (JDK 8+): `javac src/main/java/com/yourname/renderer/*.java && java com.yourname.renderer.Main`

## Usage
- Place `.obj` model files in the `models/` directory.
- Run the `Main` class to render a sample cube or custom model.
